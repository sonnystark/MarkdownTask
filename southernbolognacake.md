Whatever you think a cake is, or envision what it should look like, this bastard desert should alter your view forever. Can a cake be both *delicious* and **disgusting** at the same time?

Let's find out by checking out the ingredients, shall we?

<br>
<br>

<!-- Table -->
|Ingredient | Measure   |
|-----      |-----      |
|Sliced bologna      |1 lb     |
|Grated onion     |2 Tbsp     |
|Cream cheese      |2 pkg     |
|Worchestershire sauce      |1 Tbsp     |
|Ritz crackers      |1 pkg     |

There are a few questions that should be raised here:
1. Why?
2. Why? (again)
3. How?
4. Why did anyone think this was a good idea?

<br>
   
To give a more nuanced and less biased explanation, here's what the founder of the popular **Grandma Raised In The South** blog says:

>"Itâ€™s a great conversation piece for any party, and easy enough to make and take to a party."

Well, Southern Grandma, I think we can at least agree about this being a *"conversation piece"*.
